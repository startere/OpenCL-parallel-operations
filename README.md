OpenCL Scan

OpenCL implementation of parallel prefix sum or scan. Given an array of numbers, scan computes a new array in which each element is the sum of all the elements before it in the input array.

OpenCL Parallel Reduction

Parallel sum reduction that computes the sum of large arrays of values. This sample demonstrates several important optimization strategies for parallel algorithms like reduction.

OpenCL Radix Sort

Fast, efficient parallel radix sort implemented in OpenCL for CUDA GPUs.
